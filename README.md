# Variants

## Easy Run Variants
- **Easy run**: A comfortable, conversational pace run meant to build endurance without exerting too much effort.
- **Hill run**: A run that includes hills to build strength and endurance by challenging the muscles.
- **Steady state run**: A run at a consistent pace, faster than an easy run but not as intense as speedwork; it improves stamina.
- **Recovery jog**: A very slow and easy run to help with recovery, usually done after intense workouts or races.
- **Long run**: A run longer than your typical daily runs, aimed at improving endurance and preparing for race distances.
- **Trail run**: A run on unpaved, often uneven terrain, which challenges your balance, strength, and mental focus.
- **Base-building run**: A moderate-paced run intended to build a strong aerobic base for future speedwork and racing.

## Speedwork Variants
- **Intervals (e.g., 400m x 8, 800m x 6, 1 mile x 4)**: Repeating a set distance (usually short) at a fast pace with recovery jogs in between. This helps improve speed and cardiovascular fitness.
- **Tempo run (continuous or intervals)**: A run at a challenging but sustainable pace, often referred to as your "threshold pace," which helps improve lactate threshold and endurance.
- **Fartlek (structured or unstructured)**: A Swedish term meaning "speed play," where you vary your pace between easy and fast sections throughout the run, helping to improve both speed and endurance.
- **Hill repeats (short, long, sprint-back, alternating effort)**: Running up and down a hill, either at full speed or at a moderate pace, to build strength and speed.
- **Pyramid intervals**: A set of intervals that increase in distance (e.g., 400m, 800m, 1200m) and then decrease in distance (e.g., 1200m, 800m, 400m), providing a varied and challenging workout.
- **Ladder intervals**: Similar to pyramid intervals but with varying rest times or interval distances, which helps in improving speed and stamina.
- **Progression run**: A run that gradually increases in pace, starting slow and finishing at a faster pace, aimed at building endurance and mental toughness.
- **Negative split run**: A run where the second half is faster than the first, promoting improved pacing strategies and stamina.
- **Strides (100m accelerations with full recovery)**: Short bursts of acceleration at maximum effort for 100 meters, followed by complete rest, which enhances speed and running form.

## Cross-Training Variants
- **Cross-training (cycling)**: A low-impact activity using a bicycle, either outdoors or on a stationary bike, to improve cardiovascular fitness and leg strength.
- **Cross-training (climbing)**: Using rock climbing or indoor climbing to enhance upper body strength, grip, and coordination while also building cardiovascular endurance.
- **Cross-training (swimming)**: A full-body, low-impact workout in the pool that improves cardiovascular endurance, flexibility, and muscle strength.
- **Strength training (upper body, lower body, full body)**: Exercises aimed at building muscle strength and endurance, targeting different parts of the body through weights, resistance bands, or bodyweight exercises.
- **Core workout (planks, crunches, leg raises)**: Exercises that target the core muscles, including the abdominals, obliques, and lower back, to improve stability and posture.
- **Yoga or flexibility training**: Exercises focused on flexibility, balance, and relaxation, helping with recovery, injury prevention, and overall body mobility.
- **Rowing**: A full-body workout using a rowing machine or rowing on water that engages both upper and lower body muscles while providing a great cardiovascular workout.
- **Elliptical**: A low-impact cardio exercise performed on an elliptical machine that simulates walking, running, or climbing, providing a full-body workout.
- **Aqua jogging**: Running in water, typically in a pool, which reduces impact on joints while providing an excellent cardiovascular workout.
- **Pilates**: A workout that focuses on strengthening the core, improving flexibility, and enhancing overall body alignment and posture, often involving bodyweight exercises or equipment like reformers.
